          In <i>March: Book Two</i> we see a lot of illustrated examples of cruel racism and the ways the protesters opposed it. For instance, when there was a meeting in Ralph Abernathy's Church, we not only saw how the mob was fierce and cruel against the black people, but we also saw how the government responded to such violence. When the mob got extremely angry, the National Guard suddenly appeared and saved the people that were meeting in the church; leaders of the protest thought that the National Guard came to protect them, but after the meeting ended and people tried to go out of the church, they found out that the guard actually came to imprison them in the church. While the government wasn’t that cruel as the mod that wanted to harm black protesters, it still is very hostile to them. That way, it is harder for the protesters to continue their mission and oppose such an aggressive society and the government.

          Also, earlier in the plot, the chief of police Eugene Connor falsely arrested the freedom riders and then, after riding them to the border of Alabama state, threw them out of the cars just a few yards from the border. He knew that this is the area of the Ku Klux Klan, and willingly left them here to make sure they get in trouble. This is not the first time he tried to indirectly support violence against freedom riders: earlier, he contributed to the assault on one of the buses of freedom riders by giving the mob a promise to give them 15 minutes with the freedom riders before the police interfere. Because of his position, he cannot directly fight against freedom riders, but he still sympathizes with the Ku Klux Klan and indirectly assists them. Such racism and hatred aren’t written in the state or federal laws; but it may exist in people in charge, and, as they have a lot of power, they can actually suppress movements for the right cause.

          To sum up, we see how peaceful protests actually may enact change within society. John Lewis’ and other leaders’ of the protest fidelity to nonviolence may be one of the primary reasons for the success of the whole movement. It may seem strange and inefficient to oppose anger and crude force with peaceful disobedience, which results in protesters getting beaten, injured, or imprisoned; but eventually that tactic leads to de-escalation of tensions between sides. The benefits of peaceful demonstration, as reflected in history, far outweight the costs of violent opposition to discrimination and hatred.
