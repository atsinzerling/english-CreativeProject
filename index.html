            The issue of racism is still a very relevant problem, despite all the actions that were taken to fight it. Recent BLM protests all around the world brought even more attention to the problem of systematic discrimination and police violence against the black, which made many people interested in ways of solving the issue and the long history of fighting against racism. So, I decided to gather examples of racism in the past from pieces of literature we read in the class: <i>The Bluest Eye</i> by Toni Morrison and <i>March: Book Two</i> by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell.

            All in all, I think that examples of racism from the past described will help us better understand all the historic and social backgrounds of current movements, as well as clear out how we can continue the fight for the rights of black people.
